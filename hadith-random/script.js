let ayat18 =`(This is) a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, (Oh Muhammad), so that they may contemplate its verses, and people of reason may be mindful.

(Surah Sad, 38:29)

One of the reminders that can be found is the meaning of love. Love is widely mentioned in the Quran in many ways, such as the Divine qualities of Allah s.w.t. in multiple verses: Al-Ra-uuf (The kind), Al-Wali (The Protecting Friend), Al-Lateef (The Gentle), Al-Ghafur (The Forgiving), Ar-Rahim (The Merciful), Al-Wadud (The Affectionate Loving), just to name a few.`;
let ayat19 =`and My Mercy encompasses everything

(Surah Al-A’raf, 7:156)

Love is a gift from The Creator for His creation. It is put into the hearts of humankind and brings joy to the soul. Love is the reason life continues to blossom. It is, for the human experience; a feeling of deep affection that may inspire commitment and sacrifice. `;
let ayat20 =`Still, there are some who take others as Allah’s equal—they love them as they should love Allah—but the believers love Allah even more.

(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:165)

In other words, love for others does not necessarily have to contradict with Allah’s love, as long as we love others for the sake of Allah s.w.t and in accordance to His pleasure. However, there are other forms of love that are warned to us by Allah s.w.t. These are the bad and prohibited ones, such as love for adultery and false deities.`;
let ayat21 =`And if you should count the favours of Allah, you would never be able to number them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful

(Surah An-Nahl, 16:18)

To worship Allah while having gratitude in our hearts is one of the most fulfilling experiences in life. When we look at our lives and the wonders of the universe, we will definitely see that there is a Divine presence amidst this amazingly intelligent design in creation. `;
let ayat22 =`Spend the cause of Allah and do not contribute to your destruction with your own hands, but do good, for Allah loves those who do good (virtuous)

(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:195)

To attain a fellow human being’s love, we generally do the things that he or she loves and avoid that which he or she hates. Allah’s love is far greater than the love any human being can manifest; in fact, it is the greatest love that we can attain.`;
let ayat23 =`There certainly has come to you a messenger from among yourselves. He is concerned by your suffering, anxious for your well-being, and gracious and merciful to the believers

(Surah At-Tawbah, 9:128)`;
let ayat24 =`O mankind, be mindful of your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women. And fear Allah, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs. Indeed, Allah is ever, over you, an Observer

(Surah An-Nisa 4:1)

Every human being is created from a soul which was then dispersed into men and women. Therefore, to each is his or her own mate, where some might refer to it as a soulmate. `;
let ayat25 =`And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them, and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed, that are signs for people who give thought

(Surah Ar-Rum 30:21)

After marriage, partners tend to show sound affection and mercy to one another. This includes forgiving the other and becoming patient in facing challenges ahead. It is as clearly mentioned in the Quran that men can find tranquillity in women who are their soulmates and vice versa.`;
let ayat26 =`Your spouses are a garment (comfort, chastity, and protection) for you as you are for them

(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:187)

The literal meaning of ‘libas’ as stated in the above verse means clothing. Clothes cover our flaws and defects, protect us from external harm and it surely compliments the way we look. Likewise, spouses cover defects and protect one another from any harm. Spouses also beautify one another, leading to joy and comfort. `;
let ayat27 =`Without a doubt, Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal. He certainly does not love those who are too proud (Arrogant)

(Surah An-Nahl, 16:23)

After all, the Quran is the book of revelation from Allah s.w.t from which we refer to for reminders about many things, including love. Indeed it is guidance from The Most Merciful, Most Loving.`;
